Hey guys!ðŸ‘‹

Congratulations on finding here!

### About me
Maybe a experienced computer nerd, geek.

Java, C, PHP, Python will not do anything, but just love toss.

My code gets harder to read as I write it.

Desktop system only likes Windows10, server prefers RedHat.

Main equipment MECHREVO S1-Pro (i5-8265U MX250 8G 512G+2T) and an All In One (E5-2650L V2*2 P106-090 96G 256G*3@RaidZ2 + 6T*6@RaidZ2)

Few friends, maybe more in the future.

Like a person, not active communication. This is my personality.
