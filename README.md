Maybe a experienced computer nerd, geek.      /____/              
Java, C, PHP, Python will not do anything, but just love toss.
My code gets harder to read as I write it.
Few friends, maybe more in the future.
Like to be alone, not active communication. This is my personality.

Congratulations on finding here!âœ¨
